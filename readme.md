Features
--------

* Dual mode: Can operate as a server or client
* Concurrent operations using `lwt` library
* Flexible message protocol for generic message exchange
* Console-based user interface for easy testing and messaging
* Error handling for robustness
* Roundtrip time measurement for communication latency insights

Development Progress
-------------------

1. Init (v0.1): Set up project foundation and chose key libraries
